1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know 
all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the 
responses to these statements. 

The problem is that the when using indexOf, it does consider the characters before or after the substring you are searching for.
So, for words like "know" and "smothered", the words "no" and "mother" are still deteced within those words, and the responses
would then be "Why so negative" and "Tell me more about your family" even if these responses are completely off topic.
