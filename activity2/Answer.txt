When a keyword is imbedded into another word, Magpie will print the response with the keyword 
in it. The issue with this response is that the statement word which contains the keyword may 
not hold the same meaning as the keyword itself. For example, "smothered" has no relation to 
"mother". The problem itself stems from the .indexOf(string keyword) process for identifying
the keyword in the statement. This process scanns only the statement itself and finds the 
instance of the keyword in the statement, regardless of the relative location of the keyword.
