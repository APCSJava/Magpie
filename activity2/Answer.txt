1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? 
Consider statements like “I know all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” 
Explain the problem with the responses to these statements. 

Answer: 
Since keywords are included in another word, the response generated is based off of what 
should be the response when the key word is used alone. For example, for “I know all the state capitals”, 
the response is, “Why so negative?”. If “no” was used by itself, the response is more likely to make sense. 
However, this sentence is not negative. The method indexOf searches for if the word is included in the String statement, 
however it does not check if the key word is surrounded by spaces, or other characters.
