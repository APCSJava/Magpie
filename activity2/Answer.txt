Question 1

When presented with a sentence that contains more than one keyword that you selected to provide a unique response,
the response will be whichever one comes first in your code. For example, if you checked for the keyword, "cheese"
before checking for the keyword, "baseball", the response would be the one you set up for the keyword "cheese".

Here is the example from my code:

Me: I like baseball and cheese.
Computer: What kind of cheese do you like?
